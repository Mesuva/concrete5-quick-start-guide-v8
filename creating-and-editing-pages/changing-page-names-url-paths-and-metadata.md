# Changing Page Names, URL Paths and Metadata

## To change the name or the url of a page

1. Select the **Page Settings \(Gear\)** button on the top toolbar. 
2. Select the **SEO** option.
3. Adjust the _Name_ to adjust the page name - this is what appears on navigations and pages lists.
4. The _URL Slug_ can be changed to adjust the address/url of the page.
5. The _Meta Title_ and _Meta Description_ values can also be changed.
6. Select **Save Changes**.
7. Select the **Edit Page \(Pencil\)** button on the top toolbar.
8. Finally, select the blue **Publish Changes** button.

Note - the Page Name and URL Slug fields are also available under the _Composer_ panel. If this is available for the page you are editing you can use the fields there as well to make the same changes.

### What are the 'Meta Title' and 'Meta Descriptions' used for?

A page's metadata is information about a page that isn't displayed directly on the page, but can be automatically read by search engines. Use these fields to specify the title and description of a page that appears within a search engine result. Often these changes are performed as part of _Search Engine Optimization_, or SEO.
