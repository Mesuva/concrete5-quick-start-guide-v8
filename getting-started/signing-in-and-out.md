# Signing In and Out

To make changes to your site you will need to first sign in via the login page. This can be found by adding /index.php/login to the end of your site's address, e.g. _www.yoursite.com/index.php/login_

Enter your administrator _Username_ \(or email if prompted\) and _Password_ and press the **Sign In** button.

Signing in will return you to your site's home page, with a new tool bar across the top of the page.
