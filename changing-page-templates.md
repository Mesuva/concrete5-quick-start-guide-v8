## Changing Page Templates
Some themes offer the ability for the broader page layout itself to be changed.

To change page template:

1. Select the **Page Settings (Gear)** button on the top toolbar. 
2. Select **Design**
3. Under Page Template you will see a list of available page templates (click the Expand option to see them all)
4. Select the Page Template you wish to use. The page will refresh to preview the layout.
5. Select the green 'Save Changes' button to save the page with the newly selected layout.
